<p>Lookarounds are zero-width assertions that match a string without consuming anything. ECMAScript has lookahead
assertions that does this in forward direction, but the language is missing a way to do this backward which the
lookbehind assertions provide. With lookbehind assertions, one can make sure that a pattern is or isn't preceded by
another, e.g. matching a dollar amount without capturing the dollar sign.</p>
