    <p>A Pattern evaluates (&ldquo;compiles&rdquo;) to an internal procedure value. RegExpBuiltinExec can then apply this procedure to a String and an offset within the String to determine whether the pattern would match starting at exactly that offset within the String, and, if it does match, what the values of the capturing parentheses would be. The algorithms in <emu-xref href="#sec-pattern-semantics"></emu-xref> are designed so that compiling a pattern may throw a *SyntaxError* exception; on the other hand, once the pattern is successfully compiled, applying the resulting internal procedure to find a match in a String cannot throw an exception (except for any host-defined exceptions that can occur anywhere such as out-of-memory).</p>

    <p>The `|` regular expression operator separates two alternatives. The pattern first tries to match the left |Alternative| (followed by the sequel of the regular expression); if it fails, it tries to match the right |Disjunction| (followed by the sequel of the regular expression). If the left |Alternative|, the right |Disjunction|, and the sequel all have choice points, all choices in the sequel are tried before moving on to the next choice in the left |Alternative|. If choices in the left |Alternative| are exhausted, the right |Disjunction| is tried instead of the left |Alternative|. Any capturing parentheses inside a portion of the pattern skipped by `|` produce *undefined* values instead of Strings. Thus, for example,</p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">/a|ab/.exec("abc")</code></pre>
    <p>returns the result `"a"` and not `"ab"`. Moreover,</p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">/((a)|(ab))((c)|(bc))/.exec("abc")</code></pre>

      <p>An |Atom| followed by a |Quantifier| is repeated the number of times specified by the |Quantifier|. A |Quantifier| can be non-greedy, in which case the |Atom| pattern is repeated as few times as possible while still matching the sequel, or it can be greedy, in which case the |Atom| pattern is repeated as many times as possible while still matching the sequel. The |Atom| pattern is repeated rather than the input character sequence that it matches, so different repetitions of the |Atom| can match different input substrings.</p>
    </emu-note>
    <emu-note>
      <p>If the |Atom| and the sequel of the regular expression all have choice points, the |Atom| is first matched as many (or as few, if non-greedy) times as possible. All choices in the sequel are tried before moving on to the next choice in the last repetition of |Atom|. All choices in the last (n<sup>th</sup>) repetition of |Atom| are tried before moving on to the next choice in the next-to-last (n-1)<sup>st</sup> repetition of |Atom|; at which point it may turn out that more or fewer repetitions of |Atom| are now possible; these are exhausted (again, starting with either as few or as many as possible) before moving on to the next choice in the (n-1)<sup>st</sup> repetition of |Atom| and so on.</p>
      <p>Compare</p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">/a[a-z]{2,4}/.exec("abcdefghi")</code></pre>
      <p>which returns `"abcde"` with</p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">/a[a-z]{2,4}?/.exec("abcdefghi")</code></pre>
      <p>which returns `"abc"`.</p>
      <p>Consider also</p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">/(aa|aabaac|ba|b|c)*/.exec("aabaac")</code></pre>
      <p>which, by the choice point ordering above, returns the array</p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">["aaba", "ba"]</code></pre>
      <p>and not any of:</p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">
        ["aabaac", "aabaac"]
        ["aabaac", "c"]
      </code></pre>
      <p>The above ordering of choice points can be used to write a regular expression that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers (represented in unary notation). The following example calculates the gcd of 10 and 15:</p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">"aaaaaaaaaa,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa".replace(/^(a+)\1*,\1+$/,"$1")</code></pre>
      <p>which returns the gcd in unary notation `"aaaaa"`.</p>
    </emu-note>
    <emu-note>
      <p>Step 4 of the RepeatMatcher clears |Atom|'s captures each time |Atom| is repeated. We can see its behaviour in the regular expression</p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">/(z)((a+)?(b+)?(c))*/.exec("zaacbbbcac")</code></pre>
      <p>which returns the array</p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">["zaacbbbcac", "z", "ac", "a", undefined, "c"]</code></pre>
      <p>and not</p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">["zaacbbbcac", "z", "ac", "a", "bbb", "c"]</code></pre>
      <p>because each iteration of the outermost `*` clears all captured Strings contained in the quantified |Atom|, which in this case includes capture Strings numbered 2, 3, 4, and 5.</p>
    </emu-note>
    <emu-note>
      <p>Step 1 of the RepeatMatcher's _d_ closure states that, once the minimum number of repetitions has been satisfied, any more expansions of |Atom| that match the empty character sequence are not considered for further repetitions. This prevents the regular expression engine from falling into an infinite loop on patterns such as:</p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">/(a*)*/.exec("b")</code></pre>
      <p>or the slightly more complicated:</p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">/(a*)b\1+/.exec("baaaac")</code></pre>
      <p>which returns the array</p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">["b", ""]</code></pre>

    <emu-note>
      <p>Parentheses of the form `(` |Disjunction| `)` serve both to group the components of the |Disjunction| pattern together and to save the result of the match. The result can be used either in a backreference (`\\` followed by a nonzero decimal number), referenced in a replace String, or returned as part of an array from the regular expression matching internal procedure. To inhibit the capturing behaviour of parentheses, use the form `(?:` |Disjunction| `)` instead.</p>
    </emu-note>
    <emu-note>
      <p>The form `(?=` |Disjunction| `)` specifies a zero-width positive lookahead. In order for it to succeed, the pattern inside |Disjunction| must match at the current position, but the current position is not advanced before matching the sequel. If |Disjunction| can match at the current position in several ways, only the first one is tried. Unlike other regular expression operators, there is no backtracking into a `(?=` form (this unusual behaviour is inherited from Perl). This only matters when the |Disjunction| contains capturing parentheses and the sequel of the pattern contains backreferences to those captures.</p>
      <p>For example,</p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">/(?=(a+))/.exec("baaabac")</code></pre>
      <p>matches the empty String immediately after the first `b` and therefore returns the array:</p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">["", "aaa"]</code></pre>
      <p>To illustrate the lack of backtracking into the lookahead, consider:</p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">/(?=(a+))a*b\1/.exec("baaabac")</code></pre>
      <p>This expression returns</p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">["aba", "a"]</code></pre>
      <p>and not:</p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">["aaaba", "a"]</code></pre>
    </emu-note>
    <emu-note>
      <p>The form `(?!` |Disjunction| `)` specifies a zero-width negative lookahead. In order for it to succeed, the pattern inside |Disjunction| must fail to match at the current position. The current position is not advanced before matching the sequel. |Disjunction| can contain capturing parentheses, but backreferences to them only make sense from within |Disjunction| itself. Backreferences to these capturing parentheses from elsewhere in the pattern always return *undefined* because the negative lookahead must fail for the pattern to succeed. For example,</p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">/(.*?)a(?!(a+)b\2c)\2(.*)/.exec("baaabaac")</code></pre>
      <p>looks for an `a` not immediately followed by some positive number n of `a`'s, a `b`, another n `a`'s (specified by the first `\\2`) and a `c`. The second `\\2` is outside the negative lookahead, so it matches against *undefined* and therefore always succeeds. The whole expression returns the array:</p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">["baaabaac", "ba", undefined, "abaac"]</code></pre>
    </emu-note>
    <emu-note>
      <p>In case-insignificant matches when _Unicode_ is *true*, all characters are implicitly case-folded using the simple mapping provided by the Unicode standard immediately before they are compared. The simple mapping always maps to a single code point, so it does not map, for example, `"&szlig;"` (U+00DF) to `"SS"`. It may however map a code point outside the Basic Latin range to a character within, for example, `"&#x17f;"` (U+017F) to `"s"`. Such characters are not mapped if _Unicode_ is *false*. This prevents Unicode code points such as U+017F and U+212A from matching regular expressions such as `/[a-z]/i`, but they will match `/[a-z]/ui`.</p>
